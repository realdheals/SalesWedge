- Zig Ziglar</p>

<h2 id="introductions">1. Introductions</h2>

<p>a) “Bob Speaking”
“Bob, thanks for taking the call, we’ve never spoken before and        you don’t know me. Is this a bad time?”
“ahh no, make it quick!”</p>

<p>b) “Bob speaking”
“Bob, my name is Danny, thanks for taking my call, we make x product which helps y part of your business. Do you look after that side of the business?”
“Yes that would be me - or - no, but I can put you through to someone who does”</p>

<p>c) “Bob Speaking”
“Bob, thanks for taking my call, very quickly, If in the next 93 seconds I could introduce you to a product that would help your business make more money would you give me the time.”
“The clock starts now”</p>

<h2 id="pre-mature-price-requests">2.Pre Mature Price Requests</h2>

<p>a)”Just tell me how much it is.”</p>

<p>“The price depends. What I can tell you though is that we’re only going to do business if we have a solution that fits your budget. Let me ask you a few questions. Do you currently have a budget for X? If you did buy X, what sort of results would you want from it”</p>

<h2 id="dont-call-me">3. Don’t Call Me</h2>

<p>a) Sir, I’m sorry, it seems that I haven’t provided enough information for you to feel comfortable working with us? Am I close?</p>

<p>b) Sir, I’m sorry, have I done something to offend you?</p>

<h2 id="being-continually-rescheduled">4. Being Continually Rescheduled</h2>

<p>a) “Sir, this is the 3rd time you’ve told me you’re busy. I think you want to learn more about how this product will solve your problems though, am I right?
“Yeah I’m interested”
“Look, let’s call an intervention. I need you to commit to listening to me for 5 minutes now (or a time in the near future) and if you’re not convinced you want to proceed we can call it quits. Fair?”</p>
